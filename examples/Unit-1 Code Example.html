		<h1>WDV221 Intro Javascript</h1>
		<h2>Introduction to Javascript Syntax</h2>
		<h3>Unit-1 Code Example</h3>
		<script>
			document.write( "<h3>Javascript was used to place this H3 element on the document object. This is a runtime script that was processed as the browser built the document object (web page) that you see in your browser.</h3>");
		</script>
		<p>Hello <strong><script>document.write("Jeff"); </script>!</strong> Javascript was used to place my name within this line.</p>
		<p>Javascript can be used to manipulate any type of HTML content or CSS presentations. </p>
		<p>Can you tell by looking which of the following list elements was created with HTML versus Javascript?</p>
		<p>Key features of Javascript:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><script>document.write("It is a client side scripting language");</script></li>
		  <li>It is object oriented - that means it uses objects and properties within the document object</li>
		  <li>Works within the browser also known as the &quot;document object&quot;</li>
		  <script>document.write("<li>IT IS CASE SENSITIVE!!!</li>");</script>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Press the button to activate an alert. <button onclick="studentAlert()">Student Alert!</button> When you click on the button you activate the onclick event. Javascript is 'listening' for an onclick event to occur.  When it does it calls a function to display the alert message.

		<p>A runtime script was used to place the 'textfield' in the following form. </p>
		<form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action="#">
		  <p>
			<label for="firstName">First Name:
				<script>
					document.write( "<input type='text' id='firstName'>" );
				</script>
			</label>
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Submit">
			<input type="reset" name="button2" id="button2" value="Reset">
		  </p>
		</form>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
