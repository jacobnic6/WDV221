<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using Javascript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>
	<p id="problemOne"></p>			
		<script>
			let numOne = ""; //initialize variable for our output
			let i = 0;	//	initialize variable that we will be using to count loops starting at zero
			while(i <= 4){	//write argument i<=4 so it prints 0 through 4
				numOne += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; // addition assignment concatenating the two values of our number and the explanation with a line break added aswell
				i++; // increment i after the line has printed 
			}
			document.getElementById("problemOne").innerHTML = numOne; // write to our selected area
		</script>
	
<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
	<p id="problemTwo"></p>	
		<script>
			let numTwo = "";//initialize variable for our output
			for (let b = 4; b >= 0; b--){	// initialize our number to 4, the number we want to print first, define the condition as to continue while greater or equal to 0, then decrement by 1
				numTwo += "The number is " + b + "<br>"; // addition assignment concatenating the two values of our number and the explanation with a line break added aswell
			}
			document.getElementById("problemTwo").innerHTML = numTwo; // write to our selected area
		</script>
	
	<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
	<p id="problemThree"></p>

		<script>
			let numThree = ""; //initialize variable for our output
			for(let c = 1; c <= 5; c++){ // initialize our number to 1, the number we want to print first, define the condition as to continue while less than or equal to 0, then increment by 1
				numThree += "<p>The number is " + c + "</p>"; // addition assignment concatenating the two values of our number and the explanation with its own paragraph element
			}
			document.getElementById("problemThree").innerHTML = numThree; // write to our selected area
		</script>
	
<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
	<p id="problemFour"></p>
	<script>
		let numFour = "";//initialize variable for our output
		let d = 5;			//initialize variable for our starting value
		while(d <= 45){ // loop until a number is greater than 40. 45 is the next one in the sequence so we stop at 45
			numFour += "The number is " + d + "<br>"; // addition assignment concatenating the two values of our number and the explanation with a line break
			d += 5; // increment by 5
		}
		
		document.getElementById("problemFour").innerHTML = numFour; // write to our selected area
			
	</script>
<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>
	<script>
		function getOption(){ //create function to call so we can create the options
		let getSelect = document.getElementById("select"); // get our select element
		let optionCounter = 1; // counter to track the values of the options
		while(getSelect.length<6){	// do this until 6 values (starts at 0)
			let createOption = document.createElement("option"); //create an option element
		
			createOption.text = "Option " + optionCounter;// set the text for the option value
			getSelect.options.add(createOption);	//add the option element to the select element 
			optionCounter++; 	// increment the counter so the values print correctly
		}
		}

	</script>
<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select" onClick="getOption();">
		
    </select>
  </label>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
